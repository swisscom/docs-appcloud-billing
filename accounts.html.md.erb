Billing accounts store all your payment information. This consists of your invoice address, your contact details and your payment information (e.g. a credit card).

You can have as many billing accounts as you want to separate different billing concerns. Each [org](../concepts/roles.html#orgs) you create has to be attached to a billing account which will then pay for all the resources that are used by apps and services within spaces of that org. By doing so, you can assign different credit cards to different orgs. In the orgs sidebar on the right, you can see a list of all the orgs which are attached to the respective billing account.

*Billing accounts cannot be deleted.* However, they can be cancelled. To cancel a billing account, open the settings sidebar on the right and click the "Cancel" button. A request to cancel said billing account will be made. As soon as the cancellation is processed, all the apps and services that are living in a space which belongs to an org of said billing account will be deleted.
