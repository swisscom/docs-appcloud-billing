Billing happens via Billing Accounts. The resources you consume ar always billed by their peak usage of each day. This means that if you have an Application running for 5 minutes of one day, you will still be billed for the whole day. Furthermore, if the Application uses 64MB for one minute and 256MB for the next four minutes, you will be billed for 256MB for the whole day.
